  <p>Hi, I’m Ryan Austin! I’m a:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="list-item">Technical Sound Designer,</span></li>
    <li><span class="list-item">Composer,</span> <span class="list-item">Sound Designer,</span></li>
    <li><span class="list-item">Producer,</span> <span class="list-item">Audio Implementer,</span></li>

    <li><span class="list-item">Programmer,</span> <span class="list-item">Audio Enthusiast</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p>I’m passionate about all things audio—building interactive audio systems for games, designing sounds for media, composing diverse styles of music, and performing live. I thrive at the intersection of technology and creativity, specializing in interactive audio and game development.</p>

  <p>I grew up in Burbank, CA, and after two years at BYU in Utah, I transferred to Berklee College of Music in Boston, where I graduated with a degree in Game and Interactive Media Scoring. It was there that I developed a passion for game development, audio programming, and implementation, particularly with Wwise. I’m Wwise 101, 201, 251, and 301 certified, and I’ve created games like <i>Flighting Game</i>, which you can download right here on my website!</p>

  <p>As a multi-instrumentalist, I play guitar, piano, bass, drums, and more. I’ve performed across Los Angeles, Boston, and Salt Lake City as a guitarist and pianist, and I was part of a competitive men’s a cappella octet in high school. My passion for music extends to teaching—I’ve been a core music theory tutor at Berklee and I currently teach guitar and piano.</p>

  <p>I also spent a couple of years in Japan, where I gained conversational fluency in Japanese. At Berklee, I made the Dean’s List for academic excellence and honed my skills as a composer, sound designer, and interactive audio specialist. Now, as an aspiring technical sound designer, I’m dedicated to pushing the boundaries of interactive audio in games and creating unforgettable experiences for players and audiences alike.</p>
